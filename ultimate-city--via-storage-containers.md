# Storage Containers
What can be done efficiently/cheaply with storage containers? (aka, shipping containers, conex containers, etc...)

These storage containers can be insulated, climate controlled, and custom fitted with pretty much anything. They can be quicker and cheaper to build than similar alternatives. These containers can withstand a lot of weather and be stacked 9-high.

An example retail area idea. Some floors may be combined depending on the space available. Though, these thoughts aren't limited to storage containers.
- First floor:
    - High traffic commercial space
    - Restraunt, fast food, coffee/tea shops, 
    - Health services, first aid(?)
    - Entertainment, playground
    - Vending machines for 24/7 availability of many things
    - Restrooms
- Second floor:
    - Lower traffic commercial space, potentially having more ads. Maybe like law services, job servcies
    - Lowest traffic commercial for repeat customers. Maybe like doctors, dentists
    - Gyms. Half-price for tenants(?)
    - Entertainment
    - Child-care
- Third floor:
    - Workspaces, offices, co-working spaces, permanent private offices
    - Exclusive bathrooms for people working here
- Fourth floor:
    - Affordable housing
    - Shared bathrooms, showers, kitchen, laundry
    - Maybe health/job services
    - Shared computer lab with printer
    - Hmmm, any shared spaces? Depends on the price point of this area. Some living floors may have shared spaces, other won't.
- Fifth floor and above:
    - Living spaces with individual bathrooms, showers, (small) kitchens
    - Extra storage space available for rent for tenants. Lockers, wardrobes, and larger compartmentalized spaces.
    - A few double-wide units for larger families and higher income individuals
- Roof:
    - Argovoltaics: Agriculture and solar panels
- Living space preference will be given to anybody working at this location.
- Each living space floor will have one storage container dedicated for maintainance
- TODO: Draw ideas for different levels of available space and target market
- "Underground" options? Meh. Need to consider costs and geography. Perhaps the main/only benefit is that the area doesn't look at tall.
- There should definitely be covered walkways
- Thinking of storage containers as pre-fab, but potentially more plug-and-play and flexible. How to buy or make cheaper versions of storage containers?
