# Ultimate Living Space
Thoughts about a single living unit within a multi-unit living building.

- Entering the unit leads directly to the kitchen
- Entrance can have an enclosed closet for more expensive units.

- Bedroom not right next to toilet (maybe except for a multi-bedroom master bedroom style)

- Sliding doors: This considers the design where the door is always visible, aka doesn't hide into the wall.
    - Pro: Doesn't need as much space to open, looks nicer(?)
    - Con: More cost, takes longer to install and maintain, harder to install over-the-door organizers



Afforable housing ideas:
- Partner with Ikea?



## Open Questions
- Should the entrance open to outside or hallway?
    - If hallway, then the other end could have a large window.
    - If outside, then cheaper construction and maintainance costs.
    - If both, then could potentially have a good breeze all the way through the unit.
    - Maybe alternating both? Meh, because couldn't see loud neighbors.
