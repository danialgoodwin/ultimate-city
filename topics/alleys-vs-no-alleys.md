# Topic: Alleys vs No Alleys

Pro:
- Waste is hidden. BUT, could also hide waste in the front underground.
- A loading area that doesn't block others. If loading zones are in the front, then they may cross pedestrian routes.

Con:
- Less space for development, like commercial, green spaces, or larger pedestrian walkways.
- More road maintenance costs.

Overall, could easily fit multiple businesses in the space for an alley. Does that business make up for the cost of underground garbage areas and having garbage trucks and loading trucks in the front?

Workarounds:
- Garbage and recycling could go to a underground storage that garbage trucks could pick up whenever.
