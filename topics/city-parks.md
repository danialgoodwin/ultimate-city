# City Parks


- High-density housing nearby, mix of luxury housing and affordable housing
- Stores on the periphery - first floor of housing complexes.
- Features: Bathrooms, trails, pond and/or stream (depending on geographic area), sport fields (maybe ability to pay for good stadium lights for playing the sports at night), an area where it's possible to get lost, some large tree-lined sidewalks with space for farmer's markets, recreation center
    - Public transit stops on the periphery
    - Maybe area for food trucks. This could be the same place where there are farmer's markets. Perhaps permits required to limit number of trucks.
    - Maybe a police station on the periphery, for 'community officers'
    - Maybe schools on the periphery
- Cultural attractions: tourist center, science center, museum
