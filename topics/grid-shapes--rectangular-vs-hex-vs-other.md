# Grid shapes
Should the 'city grid' be rectangular/square?


Rectangular:
- Pro:
- Con:

Hex:
- Pro:
- Con:




Ideas:
- Maybe the center of each block could be a break area for all the employees (and the public since there will be lots of apartments on each grid square)
- Maybe each 'grid/block center' could have a different focus activity? Perhaps good enough for large tournaments. Though, it would be better for there to multiple activities so that more people could mingle. Perhaps, each 'center' should have a kid area and dog/pet area.





I like hexagons for the simple intersections. I like squares because multiple routes have the same length and people can choose different paths to take each day. Round-abouts with one-way streets can be great for less chances of collision
