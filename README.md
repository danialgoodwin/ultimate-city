# ultimate-city
My ideas for the ultimate city, including architecture, maintenance, walkability, multi-use zones, mass transit


Different types of cities include:
- Traditional 'sprawl' with large suburbia
- Built-up downtown
- City-within-a-building


Transit ideas:
- Traditional tunnels take a lot of time and money. What if we could use smaller diameter tunnels for mass transit over large areas. People would have to sit down for the duration of the trip.
- The outer side of a ring road should be (started as) protected undeveloped land in order help promote cohesive development on the inner side. Eventually, the outer side can be planned with multiple developers to built so that most people don't need to cross that ring road
- Maybe mass transit at ground-level and pedestrian walkways raised above?
    - Maybe worry about safety with people falling below?
    - Meh, perhaps all/only/mostly shops on first floor. Maybe places that typically require reservations on the second floor (doctor, dentist, school/class/meet-ups)


Sustainability ideas:
- No single-use plastics? Maybe no single-use anything? Each resident would get reuseable containers (example: https://www.barepack.co/)


- Needs: Office, retail, dining, entertainment, housing, schools, recreation, worship, parking
- Ultimate City Building
    - Different (default) floors for
        - shops. Occasional seats for resting.
        - Eating, or include with shops? Common area for eating/sitting/resting
        - businesses. Common walking path around the perimeter (at least 3 sides?). Common area for nap pods, optional. Common area for reservable conference rooms and one large conference area.
        - living. Common area with kitchen, tv(s), games, books
        - Recreation. Gym, ping-pong, board/card games, video games, child play area (plastic playground). Live video feeds 24/7 to see if things are being used or not (low-quality for privacy, at least for publically available video feed).
- Also keep in mind for first floor:
    - fire station, police, community services, city maintenance, city services, court, water treatment, waste treatment, waste, recycle,
