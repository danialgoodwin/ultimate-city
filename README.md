# ultimate-city
My ideas for the ultimate city, including: safety, maintenance, walkability (multi-use zones, mass transit), architecture.


Different types of cities include:
- Traditional 'sprawl' with large suburbia
- Built-up downtown
- City-within-a-building



Transit ideas:
- Traditional tunnels take a lot of time and money. What if we could use smaller diameter tunnels for mass transit over large areas. People would have to sit down for the duration of the trip.
- The outer side of a ring road should be (started as) protected undeveloped land in order help promote cohesive development on the inner side. Eventually, the outer side can be planned with multiple developers to built so that most people don't need to cross that ring road
- Maybe mass transit at ground-level and pedestrian walkways raised above?
    - Maybe worry about safety with people falling below?
    - Meh, perhaps all/only/mostly shops on first floor. Maybe places that typically require reservations on the second floor (doctor, dentist, school/class/meet-ups)



Sustainability ideas:
- No single-use plastics? Maybe no single-use anything? Each resident would get reuseable containers (example: https://www.barepack.co/)
    - This would likely be impossible to accomplish. But, it could still be heavily campaigned for and have fees for single-use plastic usage.



Government Services:
- Need to think of what should be controlled by government and what should be privatived. If industries are making too much money, then that's money that could be saved for individuals. For example, health care, housing, health services, education, trash/recycle/waste.
- New fees/taxes allocations are decided at the time of creation. Maybe up to 10% that can go to a general fund.



- Needs: Office, retail, dining, entertainment, housing, schools, recreation, worship, parking
    - Entertainment: private vs team vs quiet vs loud
- Ultimate City Building
    - Different (default) floors for
        - shops. Occasional seats for resting.
        - Eating, or include with shops? Common area for eating/sitting/resting
        - businesses. Common walking path around the perimeter (at least 3 sides?). Common area for nap pods, optional. Common area for reservable conference rooms and one large conference area.
        - living. Common area with kitchen, tv(s), games, books
        - Recreation. Gym, ping-pong, board/card games, video games, child play area (plastic playground). Live video feeds 24/7 to see if things are being used or not (low-quality for privacy, at least for publically available video feed).
- Also keep in mind for first floor:
    - fire station, police, community services, city maintenance, city services, court, water treatment, waste treatment, waste, recycle, hospital, amusement park
- Lots of support for small/local businesses and startups
- Scattered buildings and spaces that inspire. Regular cost-efficient rectangular buildings mostly.
- No AirBnb allowed? Tourists should be staying in hotel? Have a tourism center? Tourists should be able to get fully around with public transit
- Promote sustainable products that don't require electricity
- The library is the makerspace/hackerspace, including 3D printers, and a museum, and a child-care center
- 24-hour stores or vending machines
- Vertical farms
- Ring road with green belt3
- How to start a car-free neighborhood
    - Garage (under 24/7 surveillance) somewhere nearby ish.
    - Handle cases for emergency services and moving services. What about large grocery trips or large furniture?
- Hexagon organization. Maybe no roads exactly East-West in order to not be blinded by the sun while driving. Another good thing could be there intersections with less cars, maybe easier roundabouts.
- The night view from above could be a logo. Aka, green areas or water in that formation with no lights. Though parks typically have some lights. Maybe have ones that don't point up, or aren't that bright, or are motion-censored. Maybe good publicity if it was a cool logo
- Surrounded by a cool/interesting full marathon path, which is also wide enough for a service vehicle for the rare trash cans and mile/km markers.
- There should probably be multiple ways to each/most destinations so that the alternate routes can be taken if there is an issue (crash, maintainence, etc...)
Ultimate City. No/few lights. Allow to manually turn green for safety vehicles. Cameras at all intersections. Maybe worth it to use more road/asphalt/concrete and less places for potential collision?
- Integrated car-share (one standard to manage possibly multiple companies)
- When cars/driving is efficient, then single lanes will be enough (mostly)
- How dense (population) would a building have to be in order to make it more economical to build a parking garage? As opposed to just flat ground parking
- Increasing order of efficiency: manually driving personal cars, shared self-driving cars, bus, street car, light rail, metro (or separated lane-dedicated rail)
- Agrovoltaics: Mixing solar panels with agricultural lands. The idea is that some plants don't need/want full sunlight
- No on-street parking. Loading zones may be available.
    - Avoid the overcost on residential streets. Low-density housing taxes aren't enough to cover maintenance. Let house-owners decide if they want to have more parking on their lot or not.
    - Around commercial areas, don't need to slow down other traffic. Wider streets are unfriendly to pedestrians. It is more efficient to share a parking lot/garage with other nearby businesses. Business fronts can then open up directly to a pedestrian-friendly area and get more foot traffic rather than each person only going to places they drive to.
    - To save costs for parking garages, maybe don't need elevators by having handicap and limited-mobility spots on the first floor.
- Akihabara, Japan: https://nebula.app/videos/strange-parts-exploring-akihabara-tokyos-electronics-markets-w-only-in-japan
- Maybe a small Kirkland store with just essentials?
- Extra fees for secondary (aka, non-primary) homes/residences
- Community Officers
- Church can be a regular building on the business line. Or, held in convention center rooms
- Places for temporary storefronts, or stalls in the middle of the walkway
- Should rail be between the businesses so that passengers can see the businesses? Nah, maybe not as 'picturesque'? 
- Where to put the following: factories (can be in the same line as apartments?), water treatment (small redundancies every 5 km?), sewage treatment, landfill, water tower
- public transportation is free within the town
- no light pollution, aka make sure light is blocked going upward
- running/biking loops: 1k, 5k, 10k, 25k
    - Maybe one of those would be the boundary for the town?
- create section for recreation, food, tourism, entertainment, night life, tech,
- public bathrooms. At least for parks, maybe just big holes in the ground? Or porta-potties?
- When designing, keep fun in mind: https://www.archdaily.com/985771/placemaking-through-play-designing-for-urban-enjoyment
- Parking fees. Less expensive for long-term parking garage
- Maybe, each kilometer could be a different architectual style? Voted on by nearby citizens? Maybe, it's okay for them to expand? Don't really want to have rules/zones though.
    - Since they may be a small town anyways, maybe it's best to choose a single architectural style. Reason: Good for a tourist destination.
    - Would perhaps be nice to have its own architecture style... maybe with a little Japanese strip mall influence (vs a Las Vegas casino strip mall style).
        - Idea: Lots of greens? Perhaps looking like a forest tunnel? Hmm, maybe just the 'ceiling'/covering. If using this style, then maybe need to have the main [pedestrian] street winding. The ground can be the red ground seen for pedestrian/biking lanes. Each of the buildings could have a wood-style front (vertical grains?). Need to make sure the real trees don't disrupt biking trails.
- Look up Japanese strip malls pictures, and performance.
