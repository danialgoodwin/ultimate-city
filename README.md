# ultimate-city
My ideas for the ultimate city, including architecture, maintenance, walkability, multi-use zones, mass transit



Different types of cities include:
- Traditional 'sprawl' with large suburbia
- Built-up downtown
- City-within-a-building


Transit ideas:
- Traditional tunnels take a lot of time and money. What if we could use smaller diameter tunnels for mass transit over large areas. People would have to sit down for the duration of the trip.
