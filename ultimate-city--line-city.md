Overview:
- Start small and simple.
- This line city would East-West oriented. Reason: 

Overall organization by latitude:
- Highway: The main car/truck road/highway
- Parking lot (with extra space, starting as dirt, for future expansion)
- Loading zone: Good for shared rides and deliveries
- Line of trees (added later)
- Rail
- Businesses
- People walkway
- Businesses
- Maybe small fountains or art where transit stops are
- Maintenance road: Garbage, loading
- Apartments
- Park, aka green line: Multiple lines of trees, room for sports, playgrounds

Overall organization by longitude:
- At 0m. Have 'city hall', police, fire station, library, museum, "convention center" (multiple floors to have various uses), schools, sports fields, health services, social services, courthouse, jail

Ideas:
- No cars, by default. But, there are places for them off to the side. There will be plenty of walkable/bikable areas and public transportation.
- Units in metric, by default. For example, through-roads perpendicular to 'the line' every 500m. Transit stops every 100m. Walk-throughs every* 25m. 
- Promote "Support Local Businesses"
- There should be redundancy for the main pedestrian walkway. There would be two smaller parallel sidewalks 
- Max profit percent cap for manual labor factories. Should the government get into a manual labor business so that it can give out housing as a perk?

Public transportation:
- Start small town with frequent-ish trollies

Maybe:
- No repeat businesses within 250m? Meh
-
